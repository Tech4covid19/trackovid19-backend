## Guidelines
- __YARN__ as Package Manager
- __ASYNC/AWAIT__ Promise Style
- Database is __PostgreSQL__
- __Sequelize__ as ORM using ASYNC Client
- __FASTIFY__ as base framework (we need something simple yet speedy)
- __JWT__ as Authentication and Authorization System
- __JSON__ requests & responses

> This code is running in a serverless environment. You cannot rely on your server being 'up' in the sense that you can/should not use in-memory sessions, web sockets, etc. You are also subject to provider specific restrictions on request/response size, duration, etc.


## Instalation

> You will need atleast nodejs version 12 LTS to run this server.

###  Generate Private and Public keys to be used with JWT:

```sh
$ openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
$ openssl rsa -in private.key -outform PEM -pubout -out public.key
$ mv private.key public.key plugins/certs
```

###  Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server:

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

### Generate DB Models from Remote deployed PGSQL DB at AWS:

```sh
$ yarn generate-db
```

After the task is done, you will see the models inside models folder with the current definition from the remote DB.

### Side Notes

You will see a weird snippet inside package.json:

```json
"peerDependencies": {
	"sequelize": "^5.21.5"
}
```
This is to handle external dependencies for 3rd party modules, otherwise we will receive security warnings from deprecated / insecure modules.

## Documentation

1. Login using your facebook account on: http://localhost:3000/login/facebook;
2. You will receive a JWT token, use it as a Bearer Token in all the authenticated requests;
3. Please load the `insomnia.json` file into your Insomnia Rest Client and call the routes or consult https://trackcovid19.docs.apiary.io;

> Do not forget to set the Bearer token on insomnia!

## Serverless Usage

Install the framework:
```sh
$ npm install -g serverless
$ serverless plugin install --name serverless-stage-manager
```

Verify its installation:
```sh
$ serverless --version
```
In dev, use:
```sh
$ yarn start
```

Configure your environment:
Credentials were given before, use 'lambda' user.
```sh
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
$ export AWS_PROFILE="default"
```

```sh
$ touch ~/.aws/config
```

Paste inside `~/.aws/config`:
```sh
[default]
region=eu-west-1
```

For dev deploy, use:
```sh
$ sls deploy --stage dev --db_pass 'PASSWORD'
```

For prd deploy, use:
```sh
$ sls deploy --stage prd --db_pass 'PASSWORD'
```

You should see
```sh

```

### Debug

  

```sh
$ sls logs --stage prd -f app -t
$ sls logs --stage dev -f app -t
```

## Local Development

A docker compose yml file was added for launching a local postgres database and a web based admin app (adminer).

You can check/change all db parameters by editing the docker compose file:
```sh
$ docker/database/tracovid.yml
```

You can use the convenience start/stop scripts for starting/stopping the database, but first you need to add execute permissions:

```sh
$ chmod +x docker/database/*.sh
```

Then for starting the local database:
```sh
$ docker/database/start.sh
```

You can then go to your browser and access the database via adminer at http://localhost:8080

Stopping the local database:
```sh
$ docker/database/stop.sh
```
